\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
We have presented a novel control framework for interaction control. We have shown its applicability to the real platform and enhanced its robustness adding a safety layer which deploys ZBFs and passivity. Nevertheless there are still some interesting research directions that we aim to address in the near future. As any model-based control method, this is brittle to model mismatches. While stability is guaranteed through passivity, one could exploit interaction to find a better model estimate, closing the loop between perception and control. To this end, the haptic information readily available throughout the simulated rollouts could be actively used to drive an exploratory behavior. Another interesting idea is the use of a different policy parametrization than a multivariate gaussian such that sampling could be done more efficiently in a lower dimensional space. The proposed method is flexible enough to be applied to other system than mobile manipulators. We hope that the released library will help in this process and development of future applications.
