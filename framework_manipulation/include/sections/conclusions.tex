\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}
To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that the path integral framework has been successfully applied on a 10-DOF mobile manipulator. We have shown that the algorithm can be applied to control a complex dynamical system for contact-based tasks. Real-time control is achieved without the need for massive parallel computation but rather our method exploits fast, readily-available CPU simulators and several algorithmic adaptations that let us successfully transfer the method onto a real platform. We introduce and evaluate \textit{momentum update} to improve convergence and stability of the optimized input sequence. Lastly, we provide some practical observations and a open source \textit{robot-agnostic} implementation.
