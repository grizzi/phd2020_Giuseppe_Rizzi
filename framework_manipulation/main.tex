\begin{abstract}

In this work we investigate and deploy sampling-based control techniques for the challenging task of mobile manipulation \add{of articulated objects.} By their nature, manipulation tasks necessitate environment interactions which require the handling of non-differentiable switching contact dynamics. These dynamics represent a strong limitation for traditional gradient-based optimization methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) \add{which often rely on heuristics for trajectory generation.} \emph{Sampling-based} techniques alleviate these constraints but do not ensure \add{robots' stability and input/state constraints either.} On the other hand, real-world applications in human environments require safety and robustness to unexpected events. For this reason, we propose a novel framework for safe robotic manipulation of movable \add{articulated} objects. \add{The framework} combines sampling-based control together with \emph{Control Barrier Functions} and \emph{Passivity Theory} that, thanks to formal stability guarantees, enhance the safety and robustness of the method. 
\add{We also provide the practical insights that} enable robust deployment of stochastic control using a conventional CPU. We deploy the algorithm on a 10-DOF mobile manipulator robot. 
%\add{A video of the experiments can be found  \href{https://youtu.be/Q1AohXmsLs4}{here}}.
Finally, we open-source our generic and multi-threaded implementation.
