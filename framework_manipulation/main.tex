\begin{abstract}

In this work we investigate and deploy stochastic control techniques for the challenging task of mobile manipulation. By their nature, manipulation tasks necessitate environment interactions which require the handling of non-differentiable switching contact dynamics. These dynamics represent a strong limitation for traditional gradient-based optimization methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). \emph{Sampling-based} techniques alleviate these constraints but do not ensure that the robot will be stable and constraints will not be violated. On the other hand, real-world applications in human environment require safety and robustness to unexpected events. For this reason, we propose a novel framework for safe robotic manipulation of movable objects which combines sampling-based control together with \emph{Control Barrier Functions} and \emph{Passivity Theory} that, thanks to formal stability guarantees, enhance the safety and robustness of the method. The proposed controller enables robust deployment of stochastic control using a conventional CPU. We deploy the algorithm on a 10-DOF mobile manipulator robot. A video of the experiments can be found at \url{new-url-here}. An open-source efficient implementation of the proposed algorithms can be found at \url{https://git.io/JXi4d}.
