The accompanying video illustrates different experimental results both in simulation and on a real mobile manipulator robot.
The video shows 5 different scenarios:
1. Experiments in simulation
2. Manipulation of a cabinet door with a fixed manipulator
3. Whole-body control of a 10 DoF mobile manipulator robot
4. Whole-body control of a reactive collision avoidance task
5. Whole-body control with external disturbances
